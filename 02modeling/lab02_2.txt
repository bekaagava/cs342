Exercise 2.2

a. Yes I can add a constraint that requires that all movies having a non-NULL score value must also have more than 1000 votes. I would specify - CHECK(score IS NULL OR votes > 1000) - if the score is not null then it checks that the votes are greater than 1000. 


b. If a table already exists without a constraint and it needs one, instead of recreating the table, you create a constraint on the existing table. This would help with data cleansing processes.
