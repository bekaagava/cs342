- Data source
The data was generated from the generate data website. In order to populate the tables with 36 records each, a lot of the data does not make sense in reality.
For example, the recipes are not real, neither are there durations. The referential integrity holds for the schema, but in order to save time the references do 
not necessarily make sense. This will be addressed in the Queries part of the project. Visit http://www-personal.umich.edu/~zrenner/fridge/index.htm for a better
understanding of the project domain.

- Identification and Justification of Normal Form
The schema is in 4NF and by extension BCNF because it does not have undesirable multivalued dependencies. The nonadditive join property as well as the 
functional dependency property hold for all the relations in the schema. 

- Proof that schema satisfies BCNF and 4NF

-- Fridge(ID, brand, model, street, city, state, zipcode)

Functional Dependencies:
{ID} -> (brand, model, street, city, state, zipcode)

Candidate Key(s):
{ID}

This relation is in BCNF because there are no non-trivial FDs where the left hand side is not a superkey
This relation is in 4NF because there are no non-trivial MVDs where the left hand side is not a superkey

-- UserType(ID, name)

Functional Dependencies:
{ID} -> (name)

Candidate Key(s):
{ID}

This relation is in BCNF because there are no non-trivial FDs where the left hand side is not a superkey
This relation is in 4NF because there are no non-trivial MVDs where the left hand side is not a superkey

-- Owner(ID, userName, password, firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, userTypeID, fridgeID)

Functional Dependencies:
{ID} -> (userName, password, firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, userTypeID, fridgeID)
{userName} -> (ID, password, firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, userTypeID, fridgeID)

Candidate Key(s):
{ID}
{userName}

This relation is in BCNF because there are no non-trivial FDs where the left hand side is not a superkey
This relation is in 4NF because there are no non-trivial MVDs where the left hand side is not a superkey

-- Recipe(ID, name, description, durationUnit, durationNumber)

Functional Dependencies:
{ID} -> (name, description, durationUnit, durationNumber)

Candidate Key(s):
{ID}

This relation is in BCNF because there are no non-trivial FDs where the left hand side is not a superkey
This relation is in 4NF because there are no non-trivial MVDs where the left hand side is not a superkey

-- Ingredient(ID, name)

Functional Dependencies:
{ID} -> (name)

Candidate Key(s):
{ID}

This relation is in BCNF because there are no non-trivial FDs where the left hand side is not a superkey
This relation is in 4NF because there are no non-trivial MVDs where the left hand side is not a superkey

-- Stock(RFID, expirationDate, ingredientID, fridgeID)

Functional Dependencies:
{RFID} -> (expirationDate, ingredientID, fridgeID)

Candidate Key(s):
{RFID}

This relation is in BCNF because there are no non-trivial FDs where the left hand side is not a superkey
This relation is in 4NF because there are no non-trivial MVDs where the left hand side is not a superkey

-- OwnerRecipe(ownerID, recipeID)

There are no non-trivial FDs

Candidate Key(s):
{ownerID, recipeID}

This relation is in BCNF because there are no non-trivial FDs where the left hand side is not a superkey
This relation is in 4NF because there are no non-trivial MVDs where the left hand side is not a superkey

-- RecipeIngredient(recipeID, ingredientID, unit, quantity)

{recipeID, ingredientID} -> (unit, quantity)

Candidate Key(s):
{recipeID, ingredientID}

This relation is in BCNF because there are no non-trivial FDs where the left hand side is not a superkey
This relation is in 4NF because there are no non-trivial MVDs where the left hand side is not a superkey

-- OwnerStock(ownerID, stockID)

There are no non-trivial FDs

Candidate Key(s):
{ownerID, stockID}

This relation is in BCNF because there are no non-trivial FDs where the left hand side is not a superkey
