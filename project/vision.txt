Smart Refrigerator:

The objective of this project is to create a database to centrally handle the 
information for a Smart Refrigerator application that provides information on the items in the refrigerator, 
allows the use of recipes, and the creation of shopping lists. The potential users/stakeholders for this project
include domestic users (which would include meal planners), restaurants (which would include chefs) and labs (which would include lab technicians and chemists).
