Chapter 1

Compare and contrast data, databases, database (management) systems and information systems.

- Data refers to known facts that can be recorded and that have implicit meaning. 

- Databases are logically coherent collections of related data. They have a source from which data is derived, some degree of interaction with events in real the world, and an audience that is actively interested in their contents. Databases may be generated and maintained manually, or they may be computerized (in some instances by a database management system).

- Database (management) systems are computerized systems that allow users to create and maintain databases. They facilitate the processes of defining, constructing, manipulating and sharing databases among various users and applications.

- Information systems consist of various computers, storage systems, application software and databases. 

Data -> Databases -> DBMS & Information systems.



Compare and contrast database systems with the following, using the main characteristics of the database approach in your discussion.

- data structures and algorithms can be used to construct and manipulate data much like database systems. 

- traditional file systems are used to store data. Unlike database systems that know the data and the structure of the data being managed at a very deep level, the lowest-level data item for file systems is typically the page. 


Identify the stakeholders of database systems.
- The stakeholders of database systems are the users who need to be able to create and maintain the databases, the owners of the information in the database systems, government entities (depending on the nature of the databases that the system is being used for). 



Chapter 2

Explain the significance of the categories of data models. Which type of model is displayed in Figure 2.1?

- The high-level or conceptual data models describe data structures in ways that can be understood by people without technical backgrounds. 
- The representational or implementation data models give a more detailed description of the database structure, but they are still easily understood by end users.
- The low-level or physical data models are very detailed and describe the database structure as it organized in computer storage. This is useful to the developers.
- Figure 2.1 displays a representational or implementation data model. 


Explain the structure and significance of the three-schema architecture.
- The three-schema architecture contains:
	- an internal level, which has an internal schema that describes the physical storage structure of the database;
	- a conceptual level that has a conceptual schema, which describes the 	structure of the whole database for a community of 		users; and
	- an external or view level which includes a number of external schemas or user views that each describe the part of the 		database that a particular user group is interested in and hides the rest of the database from that user group. 
- The three-schema architecture creates convenience for the user, as it allows visualization of the schema levels in a database system. 

Explain the tiers used in a typical web-based information system.
- Many web applications use the three-tier architecture where 
	- the bottom layer includes all data management services; 
	- the middle layer acts as an application or web server (sometimes called the business logic layer) that runs application 		programs and stores business rules that are used to access data from the database server (bottom layer); and 
	- the top layer is the client layer which is sometimes called the presentation layer. It displays information to the user and 		allows data entry. It could be a GUI or a web interface.
