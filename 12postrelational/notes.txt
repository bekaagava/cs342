Exercise 12.1

1. Compare and contrast the database connection you built in Guide 12 (in Intellij IDEA) and this database connection (in GlassFish).
 Do we need both? If so, explain why; if not, explain why not.
 
The database connection built in Guide 12 is a JDBC connection between the Oracle CPDB database and the IntelliJ IDE.
The database connection for this lab is a connection between Glassfish and the oracle CPDB database. Since these connections are
for connecting different parts to the database, they are both needed.
