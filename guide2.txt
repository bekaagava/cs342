Chapter 5 (focus primarily on Sections 5.1â€“5.2)

Who invented the relational data model? When and where did they do their work?

- Ted Codd of IBM Research first introduced the relational data model in 1970.

Explain the following terms:

relation - this is a set of tuples where each member is a member of a data domain.
 
attribute - this is a column header. 

domain - this is a set of atomic (indivisible) values. 

n-tuple - this is an ordered list of n values where each value is an element of a domain.

NULL value - this represents an attribute whose value is unknown or does not exist for some individual tuple. 

primary, foreign, candidate and super keys 

- Primary keys are columns or combinations of columns that uniquely identify records.
- Foreign keys are fields (or collections of fields) in one table that uniquely identify a row of another table or the same table.
- Candidate key can be any column or a combination of columns that can qualify as unique key in database.
- A superkey SK specify a uniqueness constraint that no two distinct tuples in any relation state of a relation schema can have the same value for the SK.


referenced and referencing records - 
referenced records are referred to by a foreign key which is usually present in the referencing record. 


Are tuples in a relation ordered? How about attribute values in a tuple? Explain why or why not.

No, tuples in a relation are not ordered since a relation is defined as a set of tuples and mathematically, elements of a set have no order among them.

Yes, attribute values in a tuple are ordered since they make a list.


Can attributes have multiple values in a single n-tuple? Why or why not?

No, attributes cannot have multiple values in a single n-tuple because the n-tuple only has one element, meaning that the attribute would have a single value.
