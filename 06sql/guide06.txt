Advanced SQL (Section 7.1, continued) â€” Write sample queries that:

Implement an inner join (Section 7.1.6).

SELECT m.title, p.firstName || ' ' || p.lastName As fullName, c.status
FROM ((Movie m
JOIN Casting c ON m.id = c.movieId)
JOIN Performer p ON c.performerId = p.id);

Implement an outer join (Section 7.1.6).

SELECT m.title, p.firstName || ' ' || p.lastName As fullName, c.status
FROM ((Movie m
FULL OUTER JOIN Casting c ON m.id = c.movieId)
FULL OUTER JOIN Performer p ON c.performerId = p.id);

Use an aggregate function (Section 7.1.7).

SELECT MAX (Votes) AS Highest_Votes, MIN (Votes) AS Lowest_Votes
FROM Movie;

Use grouping (Section 7.1.8).

SELECT status, COUNT (*) AS Status_Count
FROM Casting
GROUP BY status;
